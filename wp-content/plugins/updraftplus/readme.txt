= Don't Risk Your Backups On Anything Less =

Your WordPress backups are worth the same as your entire investment in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, or your hosting company does, or they go bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Do you really want to entrust all your work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, or that has no professional backup or support? Believe us - writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

= UpdraftPlus Addons And Premium =

UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is not crippled in any way - it is fully functional for backing up and restoring your site. What we do have is various extra features (including site cloning), and guaranteed support, available <a href="https://updraftplus.com/">from our website, updraftplus.com</a>. See <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">a comparison of the free/Premium versions, here</a>.

If you need WordPress multisite backup compatibility (you'll know if you do), <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">then you need UpdraftPlus Premium</a>.

= Professional / Enterprise support agreements available =

UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is written by professional WordPress developers. If your site needs guaranteed support, then we are available. Just  <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">go to our shop.</a>

= More premium plugins =

If you are in the market for other WordPress premium plugins (especially WooCommerce addons), then try our shop, here: https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/

= Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate? =

Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

Many thanks to the existing translators - lissted at: https://updraftplus.com/translate/

= Other support =

We hang out in the WordPress support forum for this plugin - https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus - however, to save time so that we can spend it on development, please read the plugin's FAQs - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/">https://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/</a> - before going there, and ensure that you have updated to the latest released version of UpdraftPlus backup/restore.

== Installation ==

<a href="https://updraftplus.com/download/">Full instructions for installing this plugin.</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/"><strong>Please go here for the full FAQs - there are many more than below.</strong></a> Below are just a handful which particularly apply to the free wordpress.org version, or which bear repeating.

= Can UpdraftPlus do (something)? =

Check out <a href="https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">our full list of features</a>, and our <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">add-ons shop</a> and <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">free/Premium comparison table</a>.

= I found a bug. What do I do? =

Note - this FAQ is for users of the free plugin. If you're a paying customer, then you should go here: https://updraftplus.com/support/ - please don't ask question in the WordPress.Org forum about purchases, as that's against their rules.

Next, please make sure you read this FAQ through - it may already have the answer you need. If it does, then please consider a donation (e.g. buy our "No Adverts" add-on - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">https://updraftplus.com/shop/</a>); it takes time to develop this plugin and FAQ.

If it does not, then contact us (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the forum is the best way</a>)! This is a complex backup plugin and the only way we can ensure it's robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin, and that you include the version in your bug report - if you are not using the latest, then the first thing you will be asked to do is upgrade.

Please include the log if you can find it (there are links to download logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page; or you may be emailed it; failing that, it is in the directory wp-content/updraft, so FTP in and look for it there). If you cannot find the log, then I may not be able to help so much, but you can try - include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog's site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, etcetera). http://pastebin.com is a good place to post the log.

If you know where to find your PHP error logs (often a file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory (check via FTP)), then that's even better (don't send multi-megabytes; just send the few lines that appear when you run a backup, if any).

If you are a programmer and can debug and send a patch, then that's even better.

= Anything essential to know? =

After you have set up UpdraftPlus, you must check that your WordPress backups are taking place successfully. WordPress is a complex piece of software that runs in many situations. Don't wait until you need your backups before you find out that they never worked in the first place. Remember, there's no warranty and no guarantees - this is free software.

= My enormous website is hosted by a dirt-cheap provider who starve my account of resources, and UpdraftPlus runs out of time! Help! Please make UpdraftPlus deal with this situation so that I can save two dollars! =

UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning, so that it does not need to do everything in a single go; but this has limits. If your website is huge and your web hosting company gives your tiny resources on an over-loaded server, then go into the "Expert settings" and reduce the size at which zip files are split (versions 1.6.53 onwards). UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= My site was hacked, and I have no backups! I thought UpdraftPlus was working! Can I kill you? =

No, there's no warranty or guarantee, etc. It's completely up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly. If it doesn't then that's unfortunate, but this is a free plugin.

= I am not running the most recent version of UpdraftPlus. Should I upgrade? =

Yes; especially before you submit any support requests.

= Do you have any other free plugins? =

Thanks for asking; yes, we've got a few. Check out this profile page - https://profiles.wordpress.org/DavidAnderson/ .


== Changelog ==

The <a href="https://updraftplus.com/news/">UpdraftPlus backup blog</a> is the best place to learn in more detail about any important changes.

N.B. Paid versions of UpdraftPlus Backup / Restore have a version number which is 1 higher in the first digit, and has an extra component on the end, but the changelog below still applies. i.e. changes listed for 1.10.1 of the free version correspond to changes made in 2.10.1.x of the paid version.

= 1.10.1 - 2015-05-12 =

* FEATURE: Microsoft OneDrive support (Premium version) - full support (including chunked/resumable uploading and downloading)
* FEATURE: Allow prevention of backup of unwanted tables, via a filter; see: https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-a-specific-table-from-the-backup/
* FIX: Restore window would not open if date contained a single quote character in it (which was possible only in some languages)
* FIX: Restore the ability of PHP installations (< 1%) without curl to use Google Drive (broke when Google introduced a new SSL certificate at their end which PHP couldn't handle properly without extra help).
* TWEAK: Add woocommerce_order_items and relevanssi_log to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing
* TWEAK: Add link to admin email setting and fix broken link to reporting add-on in free version
* TWEAK: Provide more direct help for paid users getting blocked by the security shield when connecting for updates access
* TWEAK: Small tweak in zip-splitting algorithm if it looks likely that there are insufficient resources with no further resumptions yet scheduled
* TWEAK: "Migrate" dialogue, when the Migrator is installed, now contains a widget to use directly (instead of just directing to other route)
* TWEAK: Ask user to confirm if they navigate away from the settings page with unsaved changes
* TWEAK: Replace some non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links, and replace all non-SSL readme links
* TWEAK: Add UPDRAFTPLUS_DBSCAN_TIMEOUT constant to control how much time is allowed for scanning database, and make the default vary instead of constant (will help users with absolutely enormous databases).
* TWEAK: Provide clearer guidance to users with a wrong updraftplus.com password entered for updates
* TWEAK: When cloning a site with Jetpack, automatically clear Jetpack invalid connection status
* TWEAK: Prevent some old admin notices from being repeated when saving settings

= 1.9.64 - 2015-04-20 =

* FEATURE: (Premium) Added wizard to make it easier to create limited-access AWS users (requires PHP 5.3.3)
* SECURITY: Fix non-persistent back-end XSS vulnerability, reported by Sucuri - https://updraftplus.com/new-security-vulnerability-found-across-significant-numbers-of-wordpress-plugins-including-updraftplus/
* FIX: Fix failure to access some files (e.g. for downloading or deleting) in Google Drive folders that contained >100 UpdraftPlus backup archives (thanks to IanUK for his help)
* TWEAK: Amazon S3 reduced redundancy storage (a feature of UpdraftPlus Premium) now requires use of PHP 5.3.3 or later.
* TWEAK: Various fixes to bring automatic backups code up to date with WP 4.2 release candidate 1 (there were some changes since beta 3, which worked since UD 1.9.62)
* TWEAK: Update to version 2.0 of plugin updater class (https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker) - necessary on WP 4.2 to prevent shiny updates after the first failing when 3rd party plugins exist, and to suppress a PHP notice on the plugins page.
* TWEAK: Add wp_rp_tags to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing
* TRANSLATION: New Slovenian translation, courtesy of Clav Icula

= 1.9.63 - 2015-04-03 =

* TWEAK: Revert to previous global SSL CA bundle: it seems Amazon S3 still has servers with 1024-bit SSL certificates

= 1.9.62 - 2015-04-01 =

* FEATURE: Automatic backups now integrate with the forthcoming WP 4.2's "shiny plugin updates"
* COMPATIBILITY: Tested and marked compatible with the forthcoming WordPress 4.2 (tested up to beta 3)
* FIX: Fix regression in 1.9.60 for corner-case of S3 users with no permission to check their bucket's location (but permission to write to it).
* TWEAK: Make "settings saved" message disappear after a few seconds, to prevent UI clutter
* TWEAK: Decrease UI clutter in backup time selection
* TWEAK: Update to latest global SSL CA bundle, removing again 1024-bit root CAs (last attempted in 1.9.26, but S3 still had some legacy servers). Modern web browsers have not accepted these for 6 months now. (SSL verification can be turned off in the expert options).
* TWEAK: Defeat WP Download Manager Google Drive plugin's loading of its SDK on all pages (conflicting with UD when UD attempts to backup to Google Drive)
* TWEAK: Detect case of old MySQL on Windows with table prefix that varies by case (and hence WP actually only works by accident) - produce a consistent backup that can be restored on any MySQL server.
* TWEAK: Add dashboard notice with links to more resources, for free users who've been installed >4 weeks (with option to dismiss notice)
* TWEAK: Add itsec_log to the list of tables of non-essential/not-needing-search/replace + likely to be large tables for backup strategy
* TWEAK: Improvement to scheduling algorithm in case where WP's scheduler starts same resumption multiple times - prevent next attempt being delayed longer than necessary
* TWEAK: Add a header to report emails indicating the job ID - helps when debugging
* TWEAK: Detect + show a more helpful error message if blocked by CloudFlare when connecting for updates (paid versions)
* TWEAK: Make it easier to use custom Dropbox API keys, via UPDRAFTPLUS_CUSTOM_DROPBOX_APP constant (define to true in wp-config.php)
* TWEAK: Tweak debug output of webserver information to avoid triggering a (silly) mod_security rule in some setups
* TWEAK: Alert the user if using Amazon S3 if they do not have the PHP XML Writer module available
* TWEAK: Log the fact that local deletions are being skipped, if the user set that option.
* TWEAK: Give timestamp of WPB2D backups without relying upon location of SQL file
* TWEAK: Detect a situation on migration where the uploads path is changed (from a site that began pre-WP 3.5) that was previously undetected
* TRANSLATIONS: French translation updated from less than half to complete, thanks to Erwan François. Various other translations updated (many thanks to all translators).

= 1.9.60 - 2015-02-24 =

* FEATURE: When using "Backup Now", and keeping the UpdraftPlus settings page open, a broken WP scheduler will not prevent the backup's progress.
* FEATURE: Amazon's "EU Central 1" Frankfurt region now supported again (Amazon began requiring their new signature method at this location - probably a sign of things to come everywhere). PHP 5.3.3 required for this region.
* FEATURE: Database backup files can now be handled when uncompressed - i.e., you can remove the gzip compression, and use the resulting file (useful for large backups on slow/limited hosting: pre-decompressing the file will reduce the processing time needed)
* FEATURE: Introduced new in-page auto-backup widget that can resume, and thus cope with a backup of any size. This feature is in preparation of WP 4.2's major re-write of the updating user experience flow.
* TWEAK: Update PHP-Opencloud (Rackspace) and dependency libraries to current versions.
* TWEAK: Make sure that activity is recorded periodically when adding database tables to the final database backup (found a site with over 7,500 tables)
* TWEAK: Don't bother to attempt to detect double-gz compression on setups where it can't be handled (where gzseek() has been disabled in the PHP configuration)
* TWEAK: Added free/Premium comparison table to the free version
* TWEAK: Importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import generic .sql, .sql.gz and .sql.bz2 files
* TWEAK: Don't show the "memory limit" warning in a case where the value could not be accurately detected
* TWEAK: If the user chooses the "email" remote storage method, then a warning will be added if the archive being sent is bigger than most mailservers can carry (and will be removed if it is successfully sent), thus giving the user a hint as to the failure cause (if they overlooked the existing warning in the email settings).
* TWEAK: The importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import the latest BackupWordPress format databases
* TWEAK: Flush output buffer explicitly when closing the browser connection - prevents delayed feedback on some setups
* TWEAK: Automatic backups are now offered if you go to the 'Plugins' page, and update via the 'More information' iframe
* TWEAK: Trim spaces from Google Drive client_id/secret - some users didn't spot that they introduced whitespace when copy-pasting
* TWEAK: Add "Simple Visitor Stats" and "Simple Feed Stats" tables to the list of tables that may have large amounts of data, and which don't need search/replacing when migrating
* TWEAK: When restoring plugins and themes, log the list of entities being restored (helps with tracing problems)
* TWEAK: Deal with CloudFTP/StorageMadeEasy returning directory listings in a non-standard format, when rescanning remote backups
* TWEAK: Version numbering scheme for paid versions changed; see: https://updraftplus.com/change-in-updraftpluss-version-numbering-scheme-for-paid-versions/
* TRANSLATIONS: Updated translations in several languages (many thanks for our translators)
* FIX: For imported 3rd-party backups, the 'Existing Backups' tab (only) was showing "Unknown Source" instead of the detected source.

= 1.9.52 - 2015-02-07 =

* FIX: Fix issue when migrating (hence, in Premium versions only) backups with very large options tables output by mysqldump, which could cause the site URL to finish with an incorrect value

= 1.9.51 - 2015-02-03 =

* SECURITY: Prevent nonce leak that could allow logged-in users who aren't admins (if you have any) to access backups, UpdraftPlus settings and perform other harmful actions. No issue exists for users of UpdraftPlus Premium, or if you have the stand-alone "Automatic Backups" or "No Adverts" add-ons, or if your site has no untrusted users who can log in (or whilst have dismissed the "Automatic Backups" notice on the updates page). Credit to Sucuri (http://sucuri.net) for identifying this issue, and notifying us of it.

= 1.9.50 - 2015-01-29 =

* TWEAK: Importer now supports a previously-unseen format for WordPress Backup 2 Dropbox backups
* TWEAK: Fix cron calculation that could have prevented UpdraftPlus loading when using ALTERNATE_WP_CRON (see 1.9.45)
* TWEAK: If insufficient permissions exist when restoring, then exit maintenance mode when this is detected; and handle the case of having create but not drop permissions more elegantly
* TWEAK: Defeat some other plugins/themes which load their CSS code onto UpdraftPlus settings page and break things
* TWEAK: Prevent a "not tested on this version of WP" message showing for a short time after install of a new version, when it only applied to the previous version
* TWEAK: Reduce HTTP timeout when checking for available plugin updates (paid versions) from 10 to 5 seconds
* TWEAK: Tidy up the post-restore screen a little - one less info box.
* TWEAK: When a restore finishes, WP Super Cache's cache will be emptied (if present), to prevent confusion caused by cached pre-restore pages.
* TWEAK: Slight change to how the 'mothership' for updates is calculated, for more flexibility in our in-house testing
* TWEAK: Log more informative error if user chooses 'FTP' for their remote storage, but adds no FTP settings
* TWEAK: Change "any other directory" to "any other file/directory" in the "more files" add-on, to better reflect its capabilities
* TWEAK: Make sure that "more files" will skip UD's temporary directory, if asked to back up a parent directory of it
* TWEAK: Default to https for updates checking, with fallback to http (only relevant to versions from updraftplus.com)
* TWEAK: Prevent 'Strict Standards' PHP coding notice with WebDAV on PHP 5.5
* TWEAK: Provide clickable link through to the admin email address in the reporting settings
* TWEAK: If the gzopen or gzread functions are disabled in the PHP install, then the message saying so omitted to say which one (or both)
* FIX: WebDAV upload method could very occasionally fail to detect upload error conditions

= 1.9.46 - 2014-12-29 =

* FEATURE: Chunked/resumable uploads are now supported for SFTP
* FIX: Scan for existing backup sets added manually to local storage in recent versions could overlook some unless clicked twice, in non-GMT timezones
* TWEAK: Work-around issue in Manage WP worker plugin which caused a crash when authenticating with Dropbox
* TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice when listing files on SFTP server
* TWEAK: Reset an internal upload counter used to detect activity when a cloud storage switch is made due to no apparent activity - could prevent some large, long-running uploads on hosts with little available execution time

= 1.9.45 - 2014-12-20 =

* FIX: Fix case in which the database imported from a BackWPUp backup could be falsely identified as missing (introduced in 1.9.40)
* FIX: WordPress installs with ALTERNATE_WP_CRON set could skip some scheduled backups (since 1.9.19, so it appears that the conditions required to cause this bug are rare)

= 1.9.44 - 2014-12-13 =

* TRANSLATIONS: Add new incomplete translations (ready for the wordpress.org change to take translation availability into account when searching for plugins): Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk, Finnish, Hebrew, Catalan, Vietnamese, Bengali
* FIX: Fix a failure to detect the progress properly for large backup sets, introduced in 1.9.40

= 1.9.43 - 2014-12-11 =
* FIX: Fix bug in 'lock admin' feature causing lock-outs even with the correct password
* TWEAK: Site is put in maintenance mode whilst database restore takes place

= 1.9.42 - 2014-12-08 =
* FIX: Fix bug in 1.9.40 that caused some cloud storage uploads to be terminated.
* FIX: Restore functionality for Premium users on older WP versions (3.1 - 3.5)
